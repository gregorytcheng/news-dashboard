This is a news dashboard created out of personal need. In order to keep track of what's going on every day, I built this dashboard and a webscraper to retrieve recent news headlines and stock indices.

This app uses [React Beautiful DND](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) and [Semantic UI React](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React).
I also built a Flask backend that retrieves the data with [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

You can see a live version of the dashboard at https://gregorytcheng.github.io/news-dashboard/.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
